# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Is a system that allows us to view the history of revisions to one or more files. It is useful to merge changes made by different people. Also, if you want to revert some changes, you can easily go back to an earlier version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the main line of the project to work on. We should use branches to preserve the working condition of Master (default branch). This way we guarantee the clean condition of master, and we don't need to worry about it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is to create a save point in Git. A good commit message should be clear and meaningful, informing what was done and changed in that commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A conflict occurs when a file is changed differently in the same part and in different contexts, when merging the two branches together, Git will not be able to know which is the modification to keep and which it should discard.
