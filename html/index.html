<!-- #Reflection:
1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  
  >Give meaning for the structure of a document and roles for its elements. The most useful are tags used to define sections, like body, nav, article, aside. Headers and footers are very important, too. As they don't generate new sections in a document, each other elements (like body, article, section, aside, nav) can have their own header and footer tags. It's very important and descriptive, for example, to have a header in each section of a page indicating author's name, meta data, dates, to describe the section.

2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

  > The main outline of the HTML, which is defined by the elements order in the body and the sectioning, that could be explicit (using section defining tags) and implicit (using headings). And, then, the side content, as nav and aside.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

  > That it has built-in code snippets and we can create ours to make our life easier. I hope so!

4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

  >The snippet creation. To improve my understanding, I should start researching about it, to create more meaningful ones. Right now, I'm still not sure what would be handful to become a snippet: everything seems so important...
