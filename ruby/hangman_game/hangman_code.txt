# Hangman Game
# Specs:
# One user can enter a word, and another user attempts to guess the word.
# Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.
# Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
# The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".
# The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.

# Pseudocode
- Prompt: "Who's player 1?"
- player_1 = gets.chomp
- Prompt: "Who's player 2?"
- player_2 = gets.chomp
- Prompt player 1 to input a word
	- Input: string (secret_word)
	- Code: Split the string into characters. string.split("")
	- Output: array of characters (secret_word_chars)
- Length of the word is displayed to player 2 
- Create a loop to prompt player 2 to guess a letter until game is_over
	- Input: string (char)
	- Code: Check if game is_over. If false, verify if the input was already entered. If not, increase the guess_count in 1. Verify if the guess is correct. If yes, display the letter in its correct position in the word.
	- Output: correct_guess displayed in word
- Game is_over if:
	- guess_count is greater than word length, 
		- Output: message "Player 2 lost & player 1 won". Exit program.
	- correct_guess is equal to word_length
		- Output: tell player 2 won & player 1 lost. Exit program.
