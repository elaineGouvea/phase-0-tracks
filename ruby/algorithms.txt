#Helping a robot to ride an elevator - at the main floor of the building, going to the 6th floor:

- Walk up to face the elevator;
- Press the 1st button (from top to bottom);
- Wait until the door opens, then walk in it until reach a wall:
	- Turn to the left perpendicularly to the wall;
	- Walk up to reach a second wall;
	- Turn to the left perpendicularly to the wall (again);
	- Walk up to reach the 3rd wall, where the control pannel is;
- On the control pannel, count the buttons from bottom to top:
	- If the pannel has just one row of buttons and the ground floor is the first floor and first button from bottom to top: counting from 0-5, press button 5;
	- If the pannel has just one row and the ground floor is the first floor, but the second button from bottom to top (the 1st is a garage): counting from 0-6, press button 6;
	- If the pannel has more than one row of buttons, start counting from left to right and only when get the end of the row, move to the row above.
	- If the robot can read, press the button where number 6 is indicated.
- Wait up to hear the bell (the robot is gonna be there alone);
- After the door opens, get out of the elevator!
