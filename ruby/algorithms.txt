#Helping a robot to ride an elevator:

- At the main floor of the building, going to the 6th floor:
	- Walk up to face the elevator;
	- Press the 1st button (from top to bottom);
- Wait until the door opens, then walk in it until reach a wall:
	- Turn to the left perpendicularly to the wall;
	- Walk up to reach a second wall;
	- Turn to the left perpendicularly to the wall (again);
	- Walk up to reach the 3rd wall, where the control pannel is;
- On the control pannel, count the buttons from bottom to top (considering that the pannel has just one row and the ground floor is floor 1) from 0-5:
	- Press button 5;
	- Wait up to hear the bell (the robot is gonna be there alone);
	- After the door opens, get out of the elevator! 

#How to floss the teeth:

- At the bathroom door, walk forward until you reach the sink;
- Turn left perpendicular to the sink;
- Walk until you reach the cabinet:
	- Open its door;
	- Count the shelves from top to bottom, from 0-2;
	- Get the dental floss;
	- turn to the right perpendicular to the cabinet.
- Walk until you reach the counter:
	- Put all the things you brought from the cabinet, except for the dental floss;
	- Open the top of the package;
	- Pull 5 inches of thread;
	- Cut;
	- Leave the package on the counter.
- Put the cord in between two teeth:
	- Push and pull the dental floss for 0.5 inches 5 times;
	- Pull the thread.
- Repeat until you have done it between all the teeth - don't forget between the wisdom tooth and the end of the gum!
- Wash your mouth and now you're ready to brush the teeth.
