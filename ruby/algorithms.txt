#Helping a robot to ride an elevator:

- At the main floor of the building, going to the 6th floor:
	- Walk up to face the elevator;
	- Press the 1st button (from top to bottom);
- Wait until the door opens, then walk in it until reach a wall:
	- Turn to the left perpendicularly to the wall;
	- Walk up to reach a second wall;
	- Turn to the left perpendicularly to the wall (again);
	- Walk up to reach the 3rd wall, where the control pannel is;
- On the control pannel, count the buttons from bottom to top (considering that the pannel has just one row and the ground floor is floor 1) from 0-5:
	- Press button 5;
	- Wait up to hear the bell (the robot is gonna be there alone);
	- After the door opens, get out of the elevator!
