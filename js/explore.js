// Pseudocode - Reverse a string Algorithm
// - Create a function that takes a string as a parameter
// - Create an empty array
// - For each character of the string, iterate through the string length to change the index to a negative one, starting from 0 that becomes -1, 1 that becomes -2, etc
// - Put the reversed string into the new array
// - Join the array into a string again and returns its value
